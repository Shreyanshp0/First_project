                <p class="p">Firstly, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
                    My name is Sanjay Kumar, and I hail from Kanyakumari, the southernmost part of the Indian mainland.
                    I completed my ETO (Electro-Technical Officer) course at AMET University in the 25th batch in 2023.
                    Prior to that, I successfully completed my diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Udaya Polytechnic College, Velmodi, in the 2022 batch. Additionally, I have completed NEBOSH and IOSH courses.
                    Due to limited employment opportunities, I decided to pursue the ETO course and joined the Merchant Navy.
                    My family consists of four members, including my father (a fisherman), mother, and elder sister.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">Why I chose B-Tech</h2>
                <hr>
                <p class="p">I had technical aptitude from childhood as I liked mechanical toys and electrical equipment more than anything else. My grandfather was a village teacher and he always taught me the importance of education and encouraged me to learn whatever I was interested in. I lost my parents at an early age in an accident but my grandfather never gave me an opportunity to feel orphaned.
                    He made sure that I got admission in nearby city high school where STEM subjects were taught with great experiential method and I was able to satiate my hunger to learn some of the nitty-gritties that always made me curious and were not answered in the village school.
                    In high school itself I was fortunate enough to get an opportunity to get selected in a team of 50 students that got to work on a multinational project on hydroelectric and alternative energy making systems. It was an exposure that made me aware about some basic research techniques, and inculcated team management skills in me. It was a great opportunity not only to get subject based knowledge but in the multicultural environment I got an exposure to build my communication skills, polish critical and creative thinking skills, and work on innovative ideas and skills.</p>
